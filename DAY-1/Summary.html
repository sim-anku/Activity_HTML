 The tournament was originally scheduled to commence on 29 March 2020, but was suspended until 15 April due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on 14 April that the lockdown in India would last until at least 3 May 2020, 
the BCCI suspended the tournament indefinitely. On 2 August 2020, it was announced that the tournament would be played between 19 September and 10 November 2020 in the United Arab Emirates.
On 4 August 2020, Vivo pulled out as the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the 2020 edition. On 18 August, fantasy cricket league platform Dream11 was named the title sponsor for the season with a bid of â‚¹222 crore (US$29 million).
Defending champions Mumbai Indians successfully retained their title with a five-wicket win over Delhi Capitals in the final on 10 November 2020.
